h1. About

This is a small module providing some functionality to validate and prepare OPUS3.2 Databases for OPUS4.x migration. 

The Tool replaces a lot non-UTF-8 Codings by using the GNU command line tool sed http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/. 
The Replacements can be configured and enhanced within several files with replacement expressions.

The Tool additionally parses the XML-Dump with some xslt files, to prevent problems prior to the migration run. 
The output from the parser run shows what objects or tables have to be corrected in front of the migration

h1. Installation

copy the folder preMigrationTool with all subfolders and files into your OPUS4 Instance directory (e.g. /var/local/opus) 

h1. Usage
